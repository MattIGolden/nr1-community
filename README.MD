## Local Development

1. Open two terminals
1. In one, start up the demo site ([Demo Instructions](demo/README.md))
1. In the other, navigate to the root of this repository and run `npm run start`

Our bundler will watch for changes in /src and auto-build the library. The Demo Nerdpack will see these changes and perform its own live-reloading referencing the local copy of the library.

## How do I add my component?

1. Fork this repository
1. Create a new folder under `/components` or `/utils` with the name of your component (subject to review) and an `index.js`
1. Create a README.md that will serve as the primary documentation of your contribution
1. Create a meta.json and define the props your component requires/accepts
1. Create a new "page" (folder) in our demo Nerdpack under `/demo/nerdlets/nr1-community-demo-nerdlet/pages`. See existing components for examples.
